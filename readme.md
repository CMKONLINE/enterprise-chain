# Enterprise blockchain

This project was forked from
[naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain). Simple implementation of
blockchain that could be used for enterprise technology.

## Why?

Distributing the verification of transactions and data within a peer network
could harden security for trusted devices. Bad actors would not only have to
compromise 1 system but the entire peer network.

## Features

* Socket.io peer system
* Redis-like shared `data` system
* POW Mining
* Automatic peer discovery

### Mining

* Each block mined provides 1 token(to be used in future)

## Future

* Transactions
* Sleep Mining Until Transactions
* Verify Data
* Automatic Difficulty Adjustment
* Gas
* Smart Contracts with Lua
